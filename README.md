# VLSI-Floorplanning-Optimizer-using-Genetic-Algorithm


A sophisticated genetic algorithm implementation for solving VLSI chip floorplanning optimization problems in electronic design automation (EDA). This repository provides a comprehensive framework for optimizing component placement on semiconductor chips using evolutionary computation techniques.

## üî¨ Overview

The VLSI floorplanning problem is a critical challenge in semiconductor manufacturing that determines the optimal placement of functional blocks on a chip to minimize wire length, chip area, and component overlaps. This optimizer employs genetic algorithms (GA) to efficiently explore the solution space and converge on near-optimal layouts for complex chip designs.

Our implementation addresses three primary optimization objectives:
- **Wire Length Minimization**: Reduces interconnect distances between connected components
- **Area Optimization**: Minimizes the total bounding box area of the chip layout  
- **Overlap Elimination**: Prevents physical conflicts between chip components

## üöÄ Key Features

### Advanced Genetic Algorithm Framework
- **Multi-objective Fitness Function**: Weighted optimization considering wire length, bounding area, and overlap penalties
- **Flexible Selection Strategies**: Random, tournament, and roulette wheel selection mechanisms
- **Dual Crossover Operations**: Both single-point and two-point crossover implementations
- **Adaptive Mutation**: Coordinate-based mutation with configurable rates (5-10%)
- **Elitist Strategy**: Preserves top-performing solutions across generations

### Chip Design Capabilities  
- **Configurable Grid Dimensions**: Support for variable chip sizes (default: 25√ó25 units)
- **Multi-Component Support**: Handles 6 standard chip blocks (ALU, Cache, Control Unit, Register File, Decoder, Floating Point Unit)
- **Realistic Constraints**: Enforces physical component dimensions and interconnection requirements
- **Center-to-Center Wiring**: Euclidean distance calculations for accurate wire length estimation

### Performance & Analysis Tools
- **Convergence Tracking**: Monitors fitness evolution across generations
- **Layout Visualization**: Graphical representation of optimized chip layouts
- **Statistical Analysis**: Performance metrics and optimization convergence studies
- **Scalability Testing**: Configurable parameters for different problem sizes
